# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

I was given a project scenario by Margaret in the first Week 0 video, where I was tasked with creating an ephemeral microblogging platform named Cruddr.

## Required Homework / Tasks


### Recreate Conceptual Diagram in Lucid Charts or on a Napkin

I learned about gathering requirements, and practiced making a conceptual diagram both in napkin form, as well as in Lucid Chart!

### Create a Billing Alarm

I created a billing alarm to go off at $2.





### Create a Budget

I created 2 budgets - 

- A zero spend budget, which would send a notification if anything was spent.
- A credit usage budget, which would send a notification if 75% of $4 ($3) in credits was used.








## Obstacles

Obstacles included difficulty trying to use Cloudshell - it would not load in my browser despite being double-checking that I was in Northern Virginia (a supported region) and using a recent version of Firefox (AWS documentation states the latest 3 versions should be supported.)

I ended up installing the AWS CLI locally instead, and after running aws configure, was able to get a successful response to aws sts get-caller-identity.

I used the installation instructions found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html):

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

After configuring my setup with my credentials, I verified that it had my account information:

and I was able to use it successfully after that!

## Homework Challenges

Attempted homework challenges - made sure there wasn't inappropriate root account credentials, set up an IAM user, and set MFA.
