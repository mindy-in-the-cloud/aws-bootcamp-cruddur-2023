# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

During week 0, I was given a project scenario by Margaret.

I was tasked with creating an ephemeral microblogging platform named Cruddr.

I learned about gathering requirements, and practiced making a conceptual diagram
 - both in napkin form, as well as in Lucid Chart!

Obstacles included difficulty trying to use Cloudshell - it would not load in my browser despite being in Northern Virginia region, and using a recent version of Firefox.

I ended up installing AWS CLI locally instead, and after running aws configure, was able to get a successful response to aws sts get-caller-identity.

Attempted homework challenges - made sure there wasn't inappropriate root account credentials, set up an IAM user, and set MFA.
